# wanna use my code?
Just download the whole code and add a config.json file. You would need a mongodb uri to connect to your mongodb server

dont worry, mongodb atlas is free and you can use that to run this app.

Just add the uri inside the config.json file like below

```
{
    "uri": "your mongodb uri"
}
```

## MongoDb Configurations
